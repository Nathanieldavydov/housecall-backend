# HouseCall

HouseCall is an app that allows you, the client/customer, to find a barber or hairdresser that is available in your range and have them come to your home to provide different services. Similar to Uber, the app allows the user to find nearby barbers/hairdressers and will be able to pay through the phone and get notifications when the barber/hairdresser is on their way and when it will arrive. They will see prices that are displayed by the barber and his services.

This app is done using: 

1. React Native
2. Redux
3. Ruby on Rails

I am currently in the process of moving the backend to firebase for better integration.
At the moment, there is only a Client side, and I will be working into making the Barber side for the App.

In the future, I will be using other languages to create the app more functionable and ready for deployment for people to use.
